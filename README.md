# NETWORK-TRAFFIC-CAPTURE-AND-ANALYSIS-WITH-TCPDUMP
In this project, I used Linux networking tools to capture and analyze live network traffic. I identified available network interfaces, monitored TCP traffic with ‘tcpdump’, saved packets into a ‘pcap’ file, and performed deeper inspection of HTTP requests and responses.
